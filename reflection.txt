In my final project, I decided to use a large selection of lyrics from both The Beatles and Katy Perry. I chose this becase I wanted to get results that I thought would be fairly easily predicted. Besides comparing two songs from each of the artists, I also decided to use a Justin Bieber song, “Sorry,” to get a modern pop comparison. I also chose a less similar text to compare with each artist, The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe. 

I was extremely pleased with my results. As expected, the modern pop song “Sorry” came out as more similar to the artist from the similar time, Katy Perry. On the other hand, The Raven came out as more similar to The Beatles. This is most  likely because the Beatles, although not very far in the past compared to Edgar Allan Poe, is still closer in time to The Raven than Katy Perry. My classification program came out with all of the results I predicted, but everything can be improved. One way I would update the program would be adding more stems, especially prefixes to the list. Another way, and the most obvious, would to continue to add more and more dictionaries for certain methods of classification.Welcome to EditPad.org - your online plain text editor.
