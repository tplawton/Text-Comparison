California Girls:

I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek
(at us)

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

Cheerleader:

There is a girl in high school
She thinks she's more better than me

Dark Horse:

I knew you were
You were gonna come to me
And here you are
But you better choose carefully
Cause I...

Of anything

Make me your one and only

Once you're mine

Don't walk away

Shawty's heart is on steroids
Cause her love is so strong
You may fall in love
When you meet her
If you get the chance you better keep her
She swears by it but if you break her heart
She turn cold as a freezer
That fairy tale ending with a knight in shining armor
She can be my Sleeping Beauty
I'm gon' put her in a coma
Woo!
Damn I think I love her
Shawty so bad
I'm sprung and I don't care
She ride me like a roller coaster
Turn the bedroom into a fair
Her love is like a drug
I was tryna hit it and quit it
But lil'mama so dope
I messed around and got addicted

So you wanna play with magic

Firework:

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag,
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!",
You're gonna leave 'em falling down oh oh

You don't have to feel like a waste of space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane, comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
And when it's time you know

You just gotta ignite the light, and let it shine
Just own the night like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em falling down oh oh

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time you let it through-ooh-ooh

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
As you shoot across the sky-y-y

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go "oh, oh, oh!"
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe awe awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon

Hot N Cold:

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes
Yeah, you PMS like a bitch
I would know

And you always think
Always speak cryptically
I should know
That you're no good for me

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
You, but you don't really wanna go, oh

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in and you're out
You're up and you're down

We used to be just like twins, so in sync
The same energy now's a dead battery
Used to laugh 'bout nothing
Now you're plain boring
I should know
That you're not gonna change

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
You, but you don't really wanna go, oh

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down

Someone call the doctor
Got a case of a love bipolar
Stuck on a rollercoaster
Can't get off this ride

You change your mind
Like a girl changes clothes

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

'Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down
You're wrong when it's right
It's black and it's white
We fight, we break up
We kiss, we make up

You, you don't really wanna stay, no
You, but you don't really wanna go, oh

You're hot then you're cold
You're yes then you're no
You're in then you're out
You're up and you're down, down, down, down...


I Kissed a Girl:


This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, drink in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chapstick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter,
You're my experimental game
Just human nature,
It's not what,
Good girls do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it,

Us girls we are so magical
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent

I kissed a girl and I liked it
The taste of her cherry chap stick
I kissed a girl just to try it
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean I'm in love tonight
I kissed a girl and I liked it
I liked it


I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a soldier for you, baby, I earned all my stripes, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
So now we know it's worth it
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far, ah (Uh)

Champagne Problems:

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now
'Cause, baby, all we got
Are champagne problems now (Woo)

[Verse 2]
I wanna see you soon as I wipe the crust from my eyes
'Til the day I die, could you be the love of my life?
I'm a baller for you, baby, I pay any price, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Make-ups to the breakups
Times we coulda gave up
We put the dirty work in
Became a better version
Now we're celebrating
I'm so glad we made it this far, ah (Uh)
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now (That's all we got)
'Cause, baby, all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's all we got (All we got are)
Champagne problems now
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got, all we got (All we got are)
Champagne problems now

[Bridge]
We both know the hardest part is over
Pull me closer, pour a drink 'cause, baby
Oh woah, all we got

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, all we got (No, no, no, no; all we got are)
Are champagne problems now (That's all we got, baby)
'Cause, baby, all we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now (Champagne problems)
Yeah, that's all we got
All we got (All we got are)
Are champagne problems now
Champagne problems now

Hook Up:

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
You've got
Too much talent
I see you
Through those
Bloodshot eyes
There's a cure
You've found it

Slow motion
Sparks, You got that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes they will
They don't want
To define it
Just give up the game
And get into me
If you're looking
For thrills
Then get cold feet

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more you try
The harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

I can't cook, no
But I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down
And feel the beat
As I kiss
Your forehead

This may not
Last but this is now
So love the one
You're with
You wanna chase
But you're chasing
Your tail
And quick fix
Won't ever
Get you well

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight

Cause I feel
The distance
Between us
Could be over
With a snap
Of your fingers
Oh, oh, oh, yeah

Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I go slow
So if you want me
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing
In your pants
And your heart
On your sleeve
Oh, no
I do not
Hook up, up
I fall deep
Cause the more
You try
The harder
I'll fight
To say goodnight

Oh, sweetheart
Put the bottle down
Cause I don't wanna
Miss out

Small Talk:

Isn't it strange that you used to know me?
All the highs and lows and in-betweens
And now you see me and just say, "Hey"
Isn't it weird that you've seen me naked?
We had conversations 'bout forever
Now it's 'bout the weather‚ okay

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
Yeah

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Verse 2]
Isn't it wild that I know your weakness?
And everybody at the party thinks
That you're the best since sliced bread
And isn't it awkward I got a new somebody?
And honestly it'll probably be a while before we can just be friends

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers in a lifetime
Now just memories
We've gone from strangers to lovers to strangers
(Small talk)

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Hands haven't been)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk

[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nothing left‚ nothing left‚ baby)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Nah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Oh no)
Now there's nothing left but small talk

[Bridge]
And I just can't believe
We went from strangers to lovers to strangers

[Chorus]
Acting like we never met
Faking like we'd just forget
We were lovers
And now there's nothing left but small talk
Had every inch of your skin
There's nowhere your hands haven't been (Oh)
Ain't it funny?
'Cause now there's nothing left but small talk
(Now there's nothing left but small talk)

[Post-Chorus]
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Blah-blah-blah)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk (Now there's nothing left)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Blah-blah-blah-blah (Small talk)
Blah-blah-blah-blah
Now there's nothing left but small talk
